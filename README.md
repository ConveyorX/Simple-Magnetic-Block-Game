# Simple-Magnetic-Block-Game
A simple magnetic block game.

This project is made by Mohan Pal Singh Ubhi.

This is a simple game designed by me from scratch for self learning purposes, this game is deigned for android platform.
please let us know if you use the code from this repo. Thank you.

Mechanics:
Blocks are numbered 1-9 the blocks start at 1, they add upto 9 when all numbers are 9 the game wins. The objective for the game is beat your last scores and progress further each blocks add up from up, down, left and right sides they add upto number the total gets to (e.g. if numbers are 1 in center and 1 on side Then it catches the 1 and makes into a 2, and so on... till it numbers to 9). The gameplay video is linked on my YouTube channel.

How to build & play:
You need Unity Game Engine installed (please install from thier site if you don't have it. it's free lol!), then clone this repo and add it to unity hub and launch the project. After launch you need android build support for unity and then build and run the project to play & enjoy on your android device (also works with Microsoft Windows).

The project is open source and you can change anything (code wise) and also expand upon it to your needs. You can also replace assets as wanted (this project has no IAP or Ad's setup).

If you have any issues, bugs or suggestions don't hesitate please let us know.
